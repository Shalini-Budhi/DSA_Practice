# Problem Statement: You are given an array. The task is to reverse the array and print it.

# Examples
# Input: N = 5, arr[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
# Output: {1,2,3,4,5}
# Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position,
# the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.

# Input: N=6 arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
# Output: {40,30,20,10}
# Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, 
# the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.


def reverse_num(arr):
  left = 0
  right = len(arr)-1
  # while left < right:
  #   arr[left],arr[right] = arr[right],arr[left]
  #   right -=1
  #   left +=1


  while right > left:
    arr[right],arr[left] = arr[left],arr[right]
    left +=1
    right -=1
   
  return arr
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(reverse_num(arr))
